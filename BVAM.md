## Blockchain Validated Asset Metadata

Blockchain Validated Asset Metadata (BVAM) is a method which allows Counterparty Token metadata to be stored off-blockchain yet still be verifiable and inalterable.

http://xcp.ninja is a proof of concept server for creating and storing BVAM json files.  

Example BVAM json, http://xcp.ninja/hash/TB2rTB5FdLtqYu31wTmKgy54TYeZSqJgr3.json

Referenced Counterparty Asset, https://counterpartychain.io/asset/A11161111624187815485

### Method

1.  A third party service(s) hosts a JSON file with Enhanced Asset info (this is inline with the current protocol).  

2.  When issuing a new asset in Counterparty, the asset description references the hash of the stringify'd enhanced asset JSON data (instead of referencing the URL of the JSON file in the asset description).  To save space, the SHA256 hash is encoded, similar to a bitcoin public key but with the version numbered altered to display a "T" as the first character instead of a "1".

    *Example BVAM hash:  TB2rTB5FdLtqYu31wTmKgy54TYeZSqJgr3*
    
        var jsondata = '{"ownername":"ABC Inc.","ownertwitter":"@abcinc","owneraddress":"1GcFhAQGFZVDAr4jiR2tKwisHcgNUjhGNC","asset":"A11161111624187815485","assetname":"Widget","assetdescription":"Good for one widget.","assetwebsite":"http://abcwidgets.com"}'
        
        var firstSHA = Crypto.SHA256(jsondata)

        var hash160 = Crypto.RIPEMD160(Crypto.util.hexToBytes(firstSHA))
        var version = 0x41 // "T"
        var hashAndBytes = Crypto.util.hexToBytes(hash160)
        hashAndBytes.unshift(version)

        var doubleSHA = Crypto.SHA256(Crypto.util.hexToBytes(Crypto.SHA256(hashAndBytes)))
        var addressChecksum = doubleSHA.substr(0,8)

        var unencodedAddress = "41" + hash160 + addressChecksum

        var address = Bitcoin.Base58.encode(Crypto.util.hexToBytes(unencodedAddress))

3. The hash is prefixed in the asset description with "TOKNID-" for wallet software to identify that an asset has associated BVAM.  This represents a 41-byte asset description.  

    *Example Asset Description:  TOKNID-TB2rTB5FdLtqYu31wTmKgy54TYeZSqJgr3*

4.  Wallet software can query any third party service and trust that the data is valid without the need to trust the source.  This is accomplished by independently verifying the data hash within the wallet using the method in Step 2.

5.  BVAM must define, at a minimum, the 'asset' element within the JSON data.  This conforms to the current Counterparty Enhanced Asset Info [documentation](http://counterparty.io/docs/enhanced_asset_info/).  Additional elements can also be customized to meet the needs of each wallet provider.  Elements should be listed in alphabetical order to ensure repeatability of the JSON data hash.
