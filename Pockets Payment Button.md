Pockets Payment Button
----------------------

The Pockets Payment Button can be added to any web page and provides a user interface with Tokenly Pockets that eliminates the need to copy and paste token addresses and amounts.

Users can define the following parameters:

- Payment Address
- Payment Label
- Payment Amount
- Tokens Accepted

There are two ways to include the Pockets Payment Button into your web page...

The first method is to use the *pockets-payment-button* class.  This method only works if your parameters are known upon initial page load.
